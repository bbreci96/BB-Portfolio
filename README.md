# BB-Portfolio

Hello, My name is Bre and this is my Readme.md file for my portfolio. Even though I'm pretty sure I dont need one for a profolio, I think its still a good idea to get use to using one. 

I was looking around the internet to fine good examples of Readme.md files. From my reasearch I found that I should typically answer these questions:

1) Why did I build this project? --> Besides completing my school assignment, I know that personal portfolios are extremly important to landing web development jobs. 

2) What do I hope to learn? --> I hope I learn how to efficently use GitHub, create efficent code from scratch, and to fill in some coding gaps that I might still have. 

As I get more advance in this feild, I know that there are alot more questions that I can answer that will be of more interest to others. But as this is a personal porject that only showcases my creative ability, I will leave it to those two questions.
